### 1. Simple Webpage with Navigation
HTML: Create a simple webpage with a navigation bar, main content, and a footer. Use semantic tags like `<header>, <nav>, <section>, and <footer>`.
CSS: Style the navigation bar with a horizontal layout, add hover effects, and make the footer stick to the bottom of the page.
JavaScript: Add a script that changes the background color of the navigation bar when a user scrolls down the page.

### 2. Interactive Form Validation
HTML: Create a form with fields like name, email, password, and a checkbox for terms and conditions.
CSS: Style the form with custom borders, input focus effects, and make it responsive for mobile devices.
JavaScript: Add basic form validation that checks if all fields are filled out correctly before submitting, showing error messages if not.

### 3. Image Carousel/Slider
HTML: Set up a basic structure for an image carousel with placeholders for images and navigation arrows (next/previous).
CSS: Style the carousel with Flexbox, giving it a nice layout, borders, and animation for smooth sliding.
JavaScript: Create a script that allows users to click "next" and "previous" buttons to navigate through images. Include an automatic slide feature every 3 seconds
